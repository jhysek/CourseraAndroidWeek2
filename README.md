I'm attending a course "Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems" (https://www.coursera.org/course/android) on Coursera and I decided to rewrite examples written in Java for Android into RubyMotion code for Android.

- OriginalJava - original example from Coursera written in Java
- RubyMotionAndorid - Rubymotion version using the same layout file

Note: Example in RubyMotion does not work. Code seems correct, configuration is from an official example (https://github.com/HipByte/RubyMotionSamples/tree/master/android/Conference) but somethings is wrong. When I try to start an activity with the map, it falls just with "VM aborting" message. Official example falls when starting activity with map either, though..

If someone find out, where's the problem, please let me know.
